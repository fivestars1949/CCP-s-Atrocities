# CCP-s-Atrocities
This GitHub attempts to document the atrocities of the Chinese Communist Party it has committed so far. Knowledge is power.

As of right now, it is a growing database in its infancy providing links to resources that record the CCP's unacceptable actions.

The team welcomes everyone to suggest links that needs to be publicised and show to the world the true face of this regime.

Future developments may include translations into various languages and a mailing list on updates to the database.
